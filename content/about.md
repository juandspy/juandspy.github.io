## Who

Hey! This is Juan, a fan of software engineering, automation and getting things done. You can check out my background in the [Resume]({{< ref "/resume" >}}) page.

Some of the things I'm interested in are:

- **Software Development**: I love  coding in Go, Python and Rust (still learning), system design and building toy projects with tools like [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) and [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).
- **Dev/Ops**: IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible), Docker, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus... You know, the classic tooling.
- **Automation**: Bash. Do you need anything else? Ok, Python can be included too ðŸ˜‰.
- **Sports**: running, climbing, hiking, snowboarding...
- **Others**: productivity, guitar and Chinese.

 You can contact me on [{{< icon "linkedin" >}} LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/juands0) if you wanna know more.

## What

In this site I'll be uploading some blog posts and projects related to my interests not just in SE but also in other hobbies I have.

## Why

I always wanted to have a place to share my findings and projects, document things that took me too much to make it work or just store my thoughts. This will also push me to do different and more visible things, which may prevent me from getting stuck.

## How

This site was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and then[Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) theme. Make sure to check these projects if you want to build something similar.
