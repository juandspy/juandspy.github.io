What have you been doing all morning? If these questions sound familiar, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the powerful strategy of time blocking to help you make the most of your day.\nCall to action # I suggest you do an experiment for a day. If that seems like too much, it can be over the course of a morning or afternoon.\n1. Gather evidence # Just act as you normally do and be aware of what you spend your time on. You can use different tools for this:\nPaper and pencil, an agenda or a whiteboard A spreadsheet Toggl: a nice browser extension and app to track the time you spend on different tasks. Used quite frequently in consulting and freelancing where you have to deal with different clients. All these worked for me, but there may be others. Try not to leave any blank space. The goal is to realize the areas you spend time on and how much space you dedicate to them. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that over a single day the result is:\nArea Time (hours) Actual Work 2 Meetings 3 Slack 3 Email cleaning 0.5 Reading 0.5 Cooking 1 Home cleaning 0.5 Phone scrolling 1.5 TV/Series 1 Lunch 1.5 Sport 1.5 Sleep 8 At this point you already have some data you can decide on: are you spending too much time with non-productive stuff? Can you optimize the time you spend in meetings? Maybe you should be declining the ones you are not participating much in.\n2. Set your daily goals # Decide the amount of time you want to dedicate to each area. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that you want to do 4 hours of actual working. Then you need to reduce the time you spend in Slack, meetings or cleaning the email. Or maybe you want to book some extra time for reading.\n3. Plan the next day # Now get your numbers and plan the next day with the things you want to do. Dedicate one time block for each area or split it by tasks. For example:\nAn example on how to organize your calendar If this sounds too granular, reduce the number of time blocks. It\u0026rsquo;s important to use a different color for each area so that it\u0026rsquo;s easy to track how much time you spend on each thing.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very important to plan just the things that are not blocked. Otherwise, you would need to reshuffle the time blocks (which is not a big deal, but you should avoid it).\n4. Benefit # The first benefit you will sense is that you will stop procrastinating. Ever heard of Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s law? Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.\nBy limiting the time for each task, you\u0026rsquo;ll avoid overspending time on it.\nThis will also reduce the feeling of unproductivity as, by the end of the day, you will realize all the things you accomplished. It also let you focus on what brings value by minimizing casual scrolling, excessive time in Slack discussions, or prolonged meetings. Conclusions # Incorporating time blocking into your routine can transform the way you manage your time. Try out this strategy and share your experiences with me on LinkedIn.\nStay tuned for more productivity tips in this ongoing series!\n","date":"15 November 2023","permalink":"/posts/productivity/timeblocking/","section":"Posts","summary":"Using the time blocking strategy to make sure you get things done","title":"Time blocking"},{"content":" Who Hey! This is Juan, a fan of software engineering, automation and getting things done. You can check out my background in the Resume page.\nSome of the things I\u0026rsquo;m interested in are:\nSoftware Development: I love coding in Go, Python and Rust (still learning), system design and building toy projects with tools like Steampipe and Streamlit. Dev/Ops: IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible), Docker, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus\u0026hellip; You know, the classic tooling. Automation: Bash. Do you need anything else? Ok, Python can be included too ðŸ˜‰. Sports: running, climbing, hiking, snowboarding\u0026hellip; Others: productivity, guitar and Chinese. You can contact me on LinkedIn if you wanna know more.\nWhat In this site I\u0026rsquo;ll be uploading some blog posts and projects related to my interests not just in SE but also in other hobbies I have.\nWhy I always wanted to have a place to share my findings and projects, document things that took me too much to make it work or just store my thoughts. This will also push me to do different and more visible things, which may prevent me from getting stuck.\nHow This site was built using Hugo and then Blowfish theme. Make sure to check these projects if you want to build something similar.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Juan D.","summary":"Who Hey!","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Experience Company Link Role Dates Location Red Hat Senior Software Engineer 2023 - Present Full Remote Software Engineer 2021 - 2023 Full Remote Merkle Cloud Engineer 2021 Hybrid (Spain) Alisys Robotics \u0026 AI Team Leader 2020 - 2021 Hybrid (Spain) R\u0026D Engineer 2019 - 2020 Office based(Spain) Moma Internship 2019 Office based(Spain) Research Title Link Date Compensating atmospheric turbulence with CNNs for defocused pupil image wavefront sensors 10.1093/jigpal/jzaa045 2020 Study of the feasibility of newer neural networks in Adaptive Optics Download 2019 Education School Link Degree Date UNED Master's degree in Big Data 2019-2021 University of Oviedo Physics degree: AI for applied Physics specialization 2015-2019 ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/resume/","section":"Juan D.","summary":"Experience Company Link Role Dates Location Red Hat Senior Software Engineer 2023 - Present Full Remote Software Engineer 2021 - 2023 Full Remote Merkle Cloud Engineer 2021 Hybrid (Spain) Alisys Robotics \u0026 AI Team Leader 2020 - 2021 Hybrid (Spain) R\u0026D Engineer 2019 - 2020 Office based(Spain) Moma Internship 2019 Office based(Spain) Research Title Link Date Compensating atmospheric turbulence with CNNs for defocused pupil image wavefront sensors 10.","title":"Resume"}]
