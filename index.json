This is Juan, a fan of software engineering, automation and getting things done. You can check out my background in the Resume page.\nSome of the things I\u0026rsquo;m interested in are:\nSoftware Development: I love coding in Go, Python and Rust (still learning), system design and building toy projects with tools like Steampipe and Streamlit. Dev/Ops: IaC (Terraform, Pulumi, Ansible), Docker, Kubernetes, Grafana, Prometheus\u0026hellip; You know, the classic tooling. Automation: Bash. Do you need anything else? Ok, Python can be included too ðŸ˜‰. Sports: running, climbing, hiking, snowboarding\u0026hellip; Others: productivity, guitar and Chinese. You can contact me on LinkedIn if you wanna know more.\nWhat In this site I\u0026rsquo;ll be uploading some blog posts and projects related to my interests not just in SE but also in other hobbies I have.\nWhy I always wanted to have a place to share my findings and projects, document things that took me too much to make it work or just store my thoughts. This will also push me to do different and more visible things, which may prevent me from getting stuck.\nHow This site was built using Hugo and then Blowfish theme. Make sure to check these projects if you want to build something similar.\n","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Juan D.","summary":"Who Hey!","title":"About"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":" Experience Company Link Role Dates Location Red Hat Senior Software Engineer 2023 - Present Full Remote Software Engineer 2021 - 2023 Full Remote Merkle Cloud Engineer 2021 Hybrid (Spain) Alisys Robotics \u0026 AI Team Leader 2020 - 2021 Hybrid (Spain) R\u0026D Engineer 2019 - 2020 Office based(Spain) Moma Internship 2019 Office based(Spain) Research Title Link Date Compensating atmospheric turbulence with CNNs for defocused pupil image wavefront sensors 10.1093/jigpal/jzaa045 2020 Study of the feasibility of newer neural networks in Adaptive Optics Download 2019 Education School Link Degree Date UNED Master's degree in Big Data 2019-2021 University of Oviedo Physics degree: AI for applied Physics specialization 2015-2019 ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/resume/","section":"Juan D.","summary":"Experience Company Link Role Dates Location Red Hat Senior Software Engineer 2023 - Present Full Remote Software Engineer 2021 - 2023 Full Remote Merkle Cloud Engineer 2021 Hybrid (Spain) Alisys Robotics \u0026 AI Team Leader 2020 - 2021 Hybrid (Spain) R\u0026D Engineer 2019 - 2020 Office based(Spain) Moma Internship 2019 Office based(Spain) Research Title Link Date Compensating atmospheric turbulence with CNNs for defocused pupil image wavefront sensors 10.","title":"Resume"},{"content":"","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series"}]
