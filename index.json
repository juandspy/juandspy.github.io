In this article, we will explore an investment simulation across three main asset classes:\nFixed income: stable and predictable, based on \u0026ldquo;lending\u0026rdquo; money to entities that will return it with a fixed agreed-upon return. Examples include bank deposits, government bonds\u0026hellip; Equities: higher returns in exchange for greater volatility. Clear examples are stocks or cryptocurrencies. However, there are financial assets like index funds that have proven to be stable and highly profitable in the long term. Real estate: stable, although it requires more active maintenance and management than the previous ones. Profitability is obtained from rents or property appreciation. In this article, we will analyze how each of these investments behaves through a simulation.\nWhat is leverage? # Leverage is a financial strategy that uses borrowed money to increase investment capacity. This allows investors to buy more assets than they could with their own money. While it can increase profits, it also increases risk, as losses can be greater. It is a tool that should be used with care to avoid significant losses.\nIn the case of real estate, we are talking about a mortgage. Buying an apartment with a mortgage and renting it out means that the mortgage would be paid with rental income. It is not without risks as there could be defaults or unexpected expenses, such as special assessments, taxes, maintenance, etc.\nWhat is compound interest? # Compound interest is when you earn interest not only on the money you initially invested but also on the interest you have already earned. This means your money can grow faster over time. The longer you leave your money invested, the more it grows, because you are earning interest on an increasingly larger amount. It is a very effective way to make your savings grow in the long term.\nThis will become clearer in the simulation.\nSimulation # The following conditions are assumed:\nBank deposit return of 3%: a reasonable value as of mid-2024. Index fund return of 10%: below what the S\u0026amp;P500 has achieved in the last 30 years. Approximate net return of 5% for real estate investment. This can vary greatly between cities and countries, so the spreadsheet is made public for anyone to simulate their situation. Investment with mortgage # In both the index fund and the deposit, €41,000 is invested, the amount needed for the down payment and other expenses associated with purchasing the property.\nThanks to the higher return of the index fund, you can see that compound interest causes the value of the shares to grow exponentially. This is why it would be the most profitable option, but its volatility must be considered.\nOn the other hand, the deposit is more profitable in the short term, but in the long term, the effect of leverage in real estate investment surpasses it by far.\nTotal return Annualized return Total value Deposit 86% 4.10% €76,272 Index fund 511% 24.33% €250,461 Real estate 242% 11.51% €140,114 Investment without mortgage # In this case, €110,000, equivalent to the property purchase price, is invested in both the deposit and the index fund.\nIt can be seen that since the net return of the property is similar to that of the deposit, the accumulated net worth grows similarly. Compared to the investment with a mortgage, the growth curve is much smaller.\nTotal return Annualized return Total value Deposit 86% 4.10% €206,493 Index fund 511% 24.33% €678,078 Real estate 88% 4.20% €208,913 Obviously, in the case of the deposit and the index fund, the total and annualized returns are the same since the only condition that has changed is the initial investment. However, in the case of the property, the annual return has decreased from 11.51% to 4.20%.\nConclusions # It is clear that investment with leverage is much more profitable than without leverage. Additionally, to purchase a property without a mortgage, much more savings are needed. On the other hand, if the market continues as it has in recent decades, investment in index funds could be much more profitable.\nThere is always the option to diversify and combine these three types of investments, even with others like savings portfolios. This way, returns can be averaged, and volatilities can be compensated.\n","date":"29 June 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/investing/realstate/","section":"Posts","summary":"Is investing in real estate worth it?

What have you been doing all morning? If these questions sound familiar, you\u0026rsquo;re not alone. In this post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore the powerful strategy of time blocking to help you make the most of your day.\nCall to action # I suggest you do an experiment for a day. If that seems like too much, it can be over the course of a morning or afternoon.\n1. Gather evidence # Just act as you normally do and be aware of what you spend your time on. You can use different tools for this:\nPaper and pencil, an agenda or a whiteboard A spreadsheet Toggl: a nice browser extension and app to track the time you spend on different tasks. Used quite frequently in consulting and freelancing where you have to deal with different clients. All these worked for me, but there may be others. Try not to leave any blank space. The goal is to realize the areas you spend time on and how much space you dedicate to them. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that over a single day the result is:\nArea Time (hours) Actual Work 2 Meetings 3 Slack 3 Email cleaning 0.5 Reading 0.5 Cooking 1 Home cleaning 0.5 Phone scrolling 1.5 TV/Series 1 Lunch 1.5 Sport 1.5 Sleep 8 At this point you already have some data you can decide on: are you spending too much time with non-productive stuff? Can you optimize the time you spend in meetings? Maybe you should be declining the ones you are not participating much in.\n2. Set your daily goals # Decide the amount of time you want to dedicate to each area. Let\u0026rsquo;s say that you want to do 4 hours of actual working. Then you need to reduce the time you spend in Slack, meetings or cleaning the email. Or maybe you want to book some extra time for reading.\n3. Plan the next day # Now get your numbers and plan the next day with the things you want to do. Dedicate one time block for each area or split it by tasks. For example:\nAn example on how to organize your calendar If this sounds too granular, reduce the number of time blocks. It\u0026rsquo;s important to use a different color for each area so that it\u0026rsquo;s easy to track how much time you spend on each thing.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s very important to plan just the things that are not blocked. Otherwise, you would need to reshuffle the time blocks (which is not a big deal, but you should avoid it).\n4. Benefit # The first benefit you will sense is that you will stop procrastinating. Ever heard of Parkinson\u0026rsquo;s law? Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.\nBy limiting the time for each task, you\u0026rsquo;ll avoid overspending time on it.\nThis will also reduce the feeling of unproductivity as, by the end of the day, you will realize all the things you accomplished. It also let you focus on what brings value by minimizing casual scrolling, excessive time in Slack discussions, or prolonged meetings. Conclusions # Incorporating time blocking into your routine can transform the way you manage your time. Try out this strategy and share your experiences with me on LinkedIn.\nStay tuned for more productivity tips in this ongoing series!\n","date":"15 November 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/productivity/timeblocking/","section":"Posts","summary":"Using the time blocking strategy to make sure you get things done","title":"Time blocking","type":"posts"},{"content":" Who Hey!
